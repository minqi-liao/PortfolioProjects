In the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity. If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.

In this project, I simulated the knapsack problem in a business application. Basically, I solved the problem in two ways: Excel and python. For python, I also wrote scripts for the normal method and Googl OR-Tools method.
